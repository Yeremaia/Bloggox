## How to use the software as a dev?

After importing the repository, add the *bloggoxbd.sql* file to the database administrator (it can be phpmyadmin or whatever you like).

To have all the packages needed to run the project, type the following in the project console:

```bash
npm install
```

In the same console, do the following to make the server listen to the client:

```bash
cd .\server\
```

```bash
node index.js
```

Open another console tab and run the following to start the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The following link will appear, which will allow you to go to the software: `http://localhost:5173/`
